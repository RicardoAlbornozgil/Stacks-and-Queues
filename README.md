# Data Structures: Stacks and Queues Challenges

## Stacks
Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Common operations include pushing (adding) elements onto the stack and popping (removing) elements from the stack.
## Queues
Queues are linear data structures that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue. Queues are often used for tasks such as task scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
## Dequeues
Dequeues (Double-ended queues) are generalized queue data structures that allow elements to be inserted and removed from both ends. They support operations such as insertion and deletion from the front and rear ends. Dequeues are versatile data structures used in scenarios requiring efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends.
## Linked-Lists
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.
### Doubly-Linked-List
A doubly-linked list is a variation of a linked list where each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows traversal in both directions and enables efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list.
### Circular Linked-List
A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This allows for continuous traversal without the need for a separate end pointer and is useful in scenarios such as managing circular buffers or implementing certain types of algorithms.
